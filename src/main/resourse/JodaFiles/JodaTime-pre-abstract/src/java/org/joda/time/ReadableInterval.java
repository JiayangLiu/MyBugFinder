/** 
 * Readable interface for an interval of time between two instants.
 * <p>
 * A time interval represents a period of time between two instants.
 * Intervals are inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end.
 * The end instant is always greater than or equal to the start instant.
 * <p>
 * Intervals have a fixed millisecond duration.
 * This is the difference between the start and end instants.
 * The duration is represented separately by {@link ReadableDuration}.
 * As a result, intervals are not comparable.
 * To compare the length of two intervals, you should compare their durations.
 * <p>
 * An interval can also be converted to a {@link ReadablePeriod}.
 * This represents the difference between the start and end points in terms of fields
 * such as years and days.
